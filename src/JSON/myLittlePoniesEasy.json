Messages he sends to Celestia arrive in a much more dignified manner."

As a foal, Starlight's only friend was a colt named Sunburst, but when he got his cutie mark and moved away, Starlight felt abandoned and lonely. She became convinced that cutie marks bring only pain and the key to true friendship and happiness is for no one to be special, so no one's talents can take them away or make them feel superior. By the time of Season 5 she had was the leader of a town in which all the ponies have given up their cutie marks for equal signs, until Twilight and her friends drove her off. Starlight spied on Twilight while plotting revenge, and came up with a plan â€” using an advanced time travel spell, she went back in time and stopped Rainbow Dash from performing her first Sonic Rainboom as a filly, the event that caused the Mane Six to all get their cutie marks at the same time. However, undoing this caused time to unravel, creating various parallel timelines where villains the Mane Six had defeated were able to come to power and take over Equestria. Realizing how important the group's bonds are to Equestria, Starlight relented and accepted a hoof of friendship from Twilight.\nSeason 6 established Starlight as the Seventh Ranger to the Mane Six, a recurring supporting character who now lives with Twilight in her castle and studies friendship with her. Following her saving Equestria from Queen Chrysalis and reforming the changeling race at the end of the season, Twilight declared her to have graduated in Season 7, but Starlight wasn't ready to leave behind her new life and friends in Ponyville and decided to keep living with Twilight. Along the way, she's reunited with Sunburst and rekindled their friendship, made friends with Twilight's two-time rival Trixie, and bonded with Pinkie's sister Maud. She also made the Pillars of Old Equestria realize the mistake they'd made when the Pony of Shadows, real name Stygian, was misunderstood, and rescued him from the shadows.\nIn Season 8, Twilight enlists her as the Guidance Counselor for her Friendship School."

Feeling she wasn't getting what she wanted with Celestia, Sunset fled Equestria through a magic mirror that led her to another dimension: the human world. Through manipulation and fear, Sunset established herself as the Queen of Canterlot High School. Still craving power and dominance in Equestria, she returned to steal the Element of Magic from Twilight, intending to turn the residents of her school into brainwashed minions to invade Equestria and take it over. Twilight follows her, foils Sunset's plan, and takes back her crown. Defeated and humiliated before the school, Sunset is humbled and begs for forgiveness.\nBecoming a close friend to the human versions of Twilight's Ponyville friends, including the human version of Twilight Sparkle, Sunset has rebuilt her life and her persona as a better person, and aids the group in defending the human world from magical threats. She keeps in contact with Princess Twilight in Equestria using a pair of magic journals that can send messages to each other; these same journals keep the portal between the two worlds open and allows travel between them when Sunset needs Twilight's help more directly."

Idolizes her older sister Rarity and would like to follow her down the same career path, but isn't particularly good at it yet. Has a knack for singing and making up melodies, but balks at the thought of singing for an audience. It's strongly implied that singing and music are her special talent, but her Stage Fright keeps her from realizing this. In 'Twilight Time', she's depicted studying magic under Twilight Sparkle, but it's unclear if this is a hint she may have a magic-related talent, or is simply her learning how to use the powers she can't yet control."
