Deployed Site: [molly-pony.herokuapp.com](https://molly-pony.herokuapp.com)

## Overview

The My Little Pony Math game is a React app that is an updated version of the [Crystal-Collector](https://github.com/bryanbloomquist/crystal-collector) jQuery app I wrote for boot camp in 2018.

## How To Play

### Easy Mode

Each round 4 Cutie Marks will be displayed, there value is visible to the player.  The user clicks on them until their score matches the target score, if they do so they unlock one of 12 ponies in the open field.  Once they find all 12 the game is over, and there is no penalty for going over the target too many times.

### Normal Mode

Same as Easy mode, except that there are now 24 ponies to be rescued, and the Cutie Mark point values are hidden now.

### Hard Mode

Same basic game play as Normal mode, except now the cutie marks hidden values randomly change each game, and can be as high as 9.  There are also 60 ponies instead of 24.

### Follow up

This game is a passion project that I made for my daughter.
